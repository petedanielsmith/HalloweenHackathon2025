# Lost Souls - Halloween Hackathon 0ct 2025
Lost Souls is a site that has been created solely with the purpose of offering top-quality experiences to a market that hasn't been addressed as of yet; the Undead. The site allows our unliving users to book an event that appeals to them, whether it's a unique possession or haunting experience, or simply a little R&R away same four walls of the user's usual crypt.

## UX

### Site Purpose:
The aim of this site is to bring all undead spirits together from around the world.  It is still a rather niche market, where we hope to offer this audience something original that they wouldn't be able to find anywhere else among this mortal realm.  It also offers them the chance to interact to leave reviews based on their experiences with our service.

### Site Goal:
To propagate a variety of experiences and events our soulless companions can take full advantage of.  It aims to bring them various options to explore new haunts and/ or environments.

### Audience:
Naturally it is clearly aimed to the undead since only they can really benefit from our services, yet the living can still catch a quick preview of what's in store once they are eligible to sign up for our site.  We aim to be the first to provide this service and reunite ghouls from all different backgrounds.

### Communication:
users are provided with the possibility to review experiences and interact with one another via their reviews.

### Existing User Goals:
The endless joy of eternal scares in our ever-expanding event catalogue.

### New User Goals:
To feel welcomed by the existing community of undead users we have and explore options in the afterlife they may have never previously considered.

### Future Goals:
- We aim to build an online ouija application where many undead can taunt the living and interfere with their ceremonies, for entertainment purposes of course.
- We seek to contact other mediators around the world to help broaden our catalogue of events to choose from, appealing to different tastes our undead clients may have.

## User Stories

## Design

### Colour Scheme:

Our team have decided for this Halloween theme Hackathon to naturally go with colours that resemble our favourite holiday. 

- #0d0c13 - Typically used as background colour for the body of the page.

- #16151f - Typically used as the colour for the NavBar and the Footer of the page.

- #f6a824 - This is the colour we used for our nav-links, buttons while using a slightly lighter shade #d8900f for hover effects and button outlines.

### Imagery:
