  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>Welcome, wayward spirits, mischievous poltergeists, and restless souls!</p>

  <p>
    We’re <strong>HauntHub</strong> — the afterlife’s <em>#1 destination</em> for ghosts looking to make their next big haunting move.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ve spent centuries drifting aimlessly through creaky halls and forgotten graveyards. Isn’t it time you found a haunting spot that truly screams <em>you</em>? Whether you prefer a fog-drenched castle, a suburban cul-de-sac with plenty of terrified teens, or a cozy old inn with guaranteed bumps in the night — we’ve got you covered.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    To connect every ghost, ghoul, and banshee with their <em>dream haunt</em>.<br>
    We believe every spirit deserves a haunting ground that fits their vibe — from classy and cobwebbed to chaotic and cursed.
  </p>

  <h2>Why We Started</h2>
  <p>
    After centuries of haunting the same drafty mansions, we decided enough was enough. The living get travel sites, dating apps, and real estate listings — why shouldn’t the dearly departed?
  </p>
  <p>
    So we brewed up a bit of dark magic (and a lot of HTML) to create a place where spirits like you can browse, compare, and book your next haunting adventure — no Ouija board required.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Offer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A curated selection of <strong>prime haunting locations</strong> (each with a guaranteed 7/7 on the “scream scale”).</li>
    <li>Real reviews from other ghosts — because only fellow phantoms know what makes a good moan echo.</li>
    <li>Tools to filter haunts by vibe, activity level, and haunting history.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Promise</h2>
  <p>
    Whether you’re a gentle apparition seeking a peaceful whisper through the halls, or a vengeful wraith ready to turn a house into a horror legend — we’ll help you find your perfect match.
  </p>

  <p>
    So dust off those chains, stretch out that ectoplasm, and start browsing.<br>
    Because even in the afterlife… <strong>location is everything.</strong>
