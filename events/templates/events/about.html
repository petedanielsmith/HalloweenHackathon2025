    <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold text-warning">👻 About Us</h1>
    <p class="lead text-secondary">
      Welcome, wayward spirits, mischievous poltergeists, and restless souls!

    <p>
      We’re <strong class="text-warning">HauntHub</strong> — the afterlife’s 
      <em>#1 destination</em> for ghosts looking to make their next big haunting move.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ve spent centuries drifting aimlessly through creaky halls and forgotten graveyards. Isn’t it time you found a haunting spot that truly screams 
      <em>you</em>? Whether you prefer a fog-drenched castle, a suburban cul-de-sac with plenty of terrified teens, or a cozy old inn with guaranteed bumps in the night — we’ve got you covered.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h3 text-warning mb-3">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To connect every ghost, ghoul, and banshee with their <em>dream haunt</em>.<br>
      We believe every spirit deserves a haunting ground that fits their vibe — from classy and cobwebbed to chaotic and cursed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h3 text-warning mb-3">Why We Started</h2>
    <p>
      After centuries of haunting the same drafty mansions, we decided enough was enough. The living get travel sites, dating apps, and real estate listings — why shouldn’t the dearly departed?
    </p>
    <p>
      So we brewed up a bit of dark magic (and a lot of HTML) to create a place where spirits like you can browse, compare, and book your next haunting adventure — no Ouija board required.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="h3 text-warning mb-3">What We Offer</h2>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush bg-transparent">
      <li class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-light border-0">
        A curated selection of <strong>prime haunting locations</strong> (each with a guaranteed 7/7 on the “scream scale”).
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-light border-0">
        Real reviews from other ghosts — because only fellow phantoms know what makes a good moan echo.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-light border-0">
        Tools to filter haunts by vibe, activity level, and haunting history.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="h3 text-warning mb-3">Our Promise</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you’re a gentle apparition seeking a peaceful whisper through the halls, or a vengeful wraith ready to turn a house into a horror legend — we’ll help you find your perfect match.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-semibold text-center mt-4">
      So dust off those chains, stretch out that ectoplasm, and start browsing.<br>
      Because even in the afterlife… <span class="text-warning">location is everything.</span>
    </p>
